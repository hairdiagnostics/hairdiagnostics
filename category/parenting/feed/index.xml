										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><strong>We have many different hopes for our children.</strong> We hope they will be happy in their daily physical and emotional growth, that they will want to listen, learn and develop fulfilling skills. We hope they will be stimulated and interested in their environment and be compassionate towards themselves and others.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<img loading="lazy" class="storyImg alignnone  wp-image-2146" src="http://www.hairdiagnostics.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Inside-tunnel-1024x683.jpg" alt="Inside tunnel" width="100%" height="400" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2146" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Inside-tunnel-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Inside-tunnel-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">We may have fears too. We worry if our children often seem unwell, if they sleep poorly and lack energy. We worry if they are slow to recover from trauma, unable to cope with change and intimidated or bullied by their peers. We may be concerned for their physical strength, their ability to cooperate and follow instructions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #28a9e0"><strong class="light">What we may not realise is that all of these factors are influenced by a child’s mineral levels.</strong></span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">By examining individual mineral patterns with a <a href="/how-it-works/hair-tissue-mineral-analysis/">Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis</a>, we reveal root causes behind many of the behavioural and developmental problems of our youngest generation. In doing so, we gain an understanding of the <strong>mineral relationship between a mother and child</strong>.</span></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-2148 size-full" style="margin-left: 2em; float: right;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Child-pregnancy.jpg" alt=“Child pregnancy" width="205" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Child-pregnancy.jpg 3900w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Child-pregnancy-205x300.jpg 205w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Child-pregnancy-701x1024.jpg 701w" sizes="(max-width: 205px) 100vw, 205px" /></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000;">Throughout pregnancy, the mother&#8217;s mineral balance sets the limit on a baby&#8217;s growth and consequently, a child is always born with the same mineral patterns as their mother. The child will have fewer mineral reserves and more toxicity to manage &#8211; hair analyses of mothers and children demonstrate this in every case. Building on these congenital imbalances, and contending with stressful lifestyles, poor diets and toxic environments from birth, it&#8217;s no wonder our children are suffering unprecedented difficulties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">So what exactly are they up against? Depending on your child’s characteristics, let us give you an idea of what’s going on behind the scenes:</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span style="font-size: 14pt;">If your child is&#8230;</span><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #05538e; font-size: 14pt;"><b>Regularly Unwell</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="color: #368eca; font-size: 10pt;">The calcium to magnesium ratio is too high, indicating a compromised gut and poor elimination. Likely yeast and parasitic overgrowth, preventing detoxification and causing regular infections, skin issues and fevers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #05538e; font-size: 14pt;"><b>Anxious &amp; Fearful</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #368eca; font-size: 10pt;">The body chemistry is disordered and the oxidation rate is very fast. A likely deficiency in sedative minerals, including calcium, zinc and magnesium.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #368eca; font-size: 10pt;"><b><span style="color: #05538e; font-size: 14pt;">Easily Distracted</span> &#8211; </b>ADD, ADHD, difficulty listening and learning</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #368eca; font-size: 10pt;">High levels of toxic copper, a severe lack of zinc and selenium, and plenty of biounavailable calcium &#8211; this form of calcium cannot be utilised by the body.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #05538e; font-size: 14pt;"><b>Constantly Tired</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #368eca; font-size: 10pt;">Adrenal burnout with a low ratio of sodium to potassium. A high ratio of calcium to magnesium, demonstrating significant carbohydrate intolerance and diabetic trends.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #05538e; font-size: 14pt;"><b>Withdrawn &amp; Serious</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #368eca; font-size: 10pt;">High nickel toxicity and poor serotonin production due to compromised digestion. A low level of selenium &#8211; selenium is sometimes referred to as the ‘happy mineral’.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #05538e; font-size: 14pt;"><b>Socially Incompetent</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #368eca; font-size: 10pt;">A strong presence of heavy metals, notably lead and cadmium that fuel anger and irritate the brain. Likely mercury toxicity, giving rise to odd behaviour and autistic tendencies.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #368eca; font-size: 10pt;"><span style="color: #05538e; font-size: 14pt;"><b>Not Interested </b></span>&#8211; no matter how stimulating the environment!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="color: #368eca; font-size: 10pt;">B-complex deficiencies associated with Persistent Delayed Development (PDD). Elevated neurotoxic heavy metals leading to reduced awareness and lower vitality.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">A child that is able to relax easily, absorb information and adapt to stressful situations must have balanced mineral levels, including a good quota of zinc and selenium in the higher cortex of the brain. Self-understanding, self-awareness and an ability to tune into the immediate environment are all dependent on a child&#8217;s biochemical state.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1" style="text-align: center; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #28a9e0"><strong class="light">When we understand our children on a cellular level, we can implement specific, corrective measures to improve their development.</strong></span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">We must analyse, not only the body’s mineral levels, but also diet, lifestyle and other sensitivities, with <strong>an aim of reducing all internal and external stress</strong>. This is the only way to target and rebalance health for the long term, it is the science of Nutritional Balancing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">The good news is that, because children are growing so rapidly, they can make changes quickly and get back on track.
