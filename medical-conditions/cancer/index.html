<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Cancer is a primary 21st century disease.</b> It is one of the most important diseases of this century, and one that wastes millions of lives. Close to one in every two Americans will be diagnosed with it, and the cancer rates are similar around the world. Many others die as a result of a hidden cancer that causes another problem such as a ruptured artery or a stroke.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>A fear-filled situation.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For these reasons, cancer evokes terrible fear today, probably more than most other illnesses. This means that doctors are afraid of it, as well as patients. Media outlets also express fear in many ways that can scare people.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Not hopeless, ever.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I have seen full recoveries from cancer, even advanced cases. This statement is based on over 34 years of assisting over 50,000 people with their health.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>My own experience with cancer.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This began with my brother’s diagnosis of Hodgkins’s disease in 1967 at the age of 15. He did not survive, in large part because I didn’t know how to help him. However, I discovered, quite by accident, that there is an entire world of alternative cancer therapies that goes unrecognised and is often actively suppressed by the mainstream medical profession and the media.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>I also became terrified of cancer.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This helped motivate me to research and experiment on myself, in hopes of understanding this condition more.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>A research report.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This article is a research report on my observations as a doctor who is willing to search outside the mainstream medical literature for answers.</span></p>

Warnings</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Remove all root canal-filled teeth if you want to recover from cancer or prevent cancer. This is a must!</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">A Nutritional Balancing programme will usually get rid of dental cavitations, which can also cause cancer.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">A lot of the black salve on the market now does not work. Be sure to use only the recommended brands.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Never use black salve internally more than once every few weeks, and a tiny amount only. Some false healers are advising using it more often and it is very irritating to do this. Never do this!</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Under Obamacare in the US, you can be arrested for not following doctor’s orders. Please be careful when getting involved with doctors and hospitals, and if you don’t <span id="disclaimer"></span>want to do what they suggest, don’t say that. Instead, say you are going to get a second opinion, which is okay.</span></p>

</li>
<li>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">No promises or guarantees can ever be made with any therapy. This must be made absolutely<span id="handling-cancer-cases"></span> clear. However, the right natural methods have helped many people overcome cancer.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1">Handling cancer cases</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">For doctors interested in helping others, assisting those with cancer is quite difficult. The reasons are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Self-sabotage is common among cancer patients.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Self-sabotage means that the patient often does things that destroy the effectiveness of the natural programme. They may forget to follow the diet, or forget to take supplements, or something else. The reasons for this are explained, in part, below.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Most with cancer are confused, scared and perhaps angry.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This gets in the way of success in some cases.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Medical pressure.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Doctors often put a lot of pressure on patients and their families to follow conventional protocols.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Family and other social pressures.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Families and friends often put a lot of pressure on patients to avoid natural methods and follow conventional methods.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Legal pressures.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In some states, political authorities insist upon conventional drug, radiation and surgical procedures for cancer and prosecute anyone who offers alternatives, even if the conventional methods do not work. This is rather insane, but one must recall that conventional cancer therapy is very costly and is a big business.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Use of very toxic medical remedies.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some cancer patients have already had chemotherapy<span id="cancer-politics"></span> and radiation, and perhaps surgical therapies that have compromised the body’s ability to heal itself. This complicates natural therapies.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1"><span class="s1">Cancer politics</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">The AMA (American Medical Association) and other powerful medical groups do not like the competition from natural cancer therapies. Doctors who offer it are often harassed by federal agents, and some lose their licenses for helping people recover from a terminal disease. However, many prominent politicians and others know about these therapies. Ronald Reagan and Betty Ford are just two among many who received natural, alternative cancer therapies and succeeded.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">You will generally not hear about the alternatives I will suggest below because they do not involve patentable drugs, or radiation therapy. As a result, the drug industry and others cannot profit from them. This sounds very cynical, but it is the truth, and nothing but the truth. The pharmaceutical industry has infiltrated medical care to an enormous degree. They mainly profit from patentable products, which does not include foods, vitamins, minerals, oxygen therapy, herbs and similar products.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">The drug industry and their allies strongly discourage the public from using natural cancer therapies, mainly by controlling what doctors learn and how they practice their trade. Control is accomplished through the medical licensing laws, hospital regulations, laboratory regulations, and extensive media control. Several excellent books have been written about the sad and insane control of the drug companies over medical care, and particularly as regards cancer therapy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Medical studies of cancer remedies.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One must be extremely wary of “medical studies” about cancer because most are biased and manipulated to achieve a certain outcome. Here are just a few ways that studies are rigged to produce a certain outcome:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Studies often discuss <b>the “5-year survival rate”</b> of various therapies. If a person lives for five years, he or she is considered cured. If the person dies even one day after the five years is up, the person is still categorised as “cured”. This, of course, is insane, since most people want to live more than five years. But this is how the statistics are set up, although most people do not know this.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Drugs are often tested for only a short time</b>, during which the drug may show “promise”. The drug maker knows that if they extended the time a few more months or a year, it would fail, but they do not report this fact.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Often, a special group of people are used in the study that the authors know will do well on a drug. Yet this is not revealed. Alternatively, when “studying” a natural therapy, the authors of the study may select participants that they know will not do well, but they do not reveal this fact.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">If a person participating in a drug study dies before completing the trial period, that person may be removed entirely from the study because he or she did not complete the study. This skews the study and makes it look much more successful than it really was.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">In one drug trial, <b>rats died during the study period, and were simply replaced</b> by new rats in order to complete the study.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">The “study” of alternative methods are done with <b>only one or a few participants</b>. This should not be considered valid, but it often is. Medical studies to discredit hair analysis were rigged this way, for example.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Authors of drug studies are often paid by drug companies</b> to conclude something the study really does not show, often while ignoring the real facts or conclusions. However, you would never know this unless you read the study very carefully.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">A “study” can easily discredit a new method of cancer therapy by using the wrong dosage, the wrong protocol for the product, or even the wrong product. This is done very commonly. It might even look like a silly “mistake”, but it is no such thing.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Something is added to or omitted from the “study”</b> protocol that wrecks the intended effect. For example, if a natural product also requires a healthful diet along with it, the dietary part is omitted and the product “studied” without the diet.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">I found that studies of natural products at major cancer centres in the United States found benefit in natural methods. However, the results were either not reported in medical journals, or they were buried in other ways so that doctors and others did not find out about them.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Dozens of other tricks can be used to either make a product seem effective when it is not, or to discredit a valid method. The above are just a small sampling of how scientific studies can be biased, and how the public and doctors are kept in the dark about the dismal performance of much of drug medicine. This ignorance and deception today pervades the entire medical establishment, even the most elite medical centres<span id="kinds-of-cancers"></span>. However, it is perhaps most pronounced in the area of cancer therapy.</span></p>
<p class="p1">
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1">Kinds of cancers</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Not all cancers are the same in their cause. Here are a few types I have encountered. They overlap somewhat, but it is important to figure out what caused your cancer in order to overcome it:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Emotional and stress cancers.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These cancers are primarily due to stress. The stress can be financial, emotional, family or other. Reducing the stress is essential or the person will not do well. Sometimes resentments, hidden anger, hidden fears or other emotional issues are also at play, and need to be exposed and reduced or success will not occur.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Toxic and nutritionally caused cancers.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These are common cancers. To get rid of them, one must remove the toxins from the body and replenish the alkaline reserve minerals in the body. Nothing less will do. The toxins can be:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Toxic chemicals</b> found in our air, food, water and ddue to skin or other contact.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Toxic metals.</b> These include metals such as arsenic and cadmium.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Biological toxins. </b> These are mainly infections in the teeth, for some reason.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>However, one could have a hidden infection anywhere in the body giving off powerful toxins that spread through the blood and poison the entire body.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Emotional toxins.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These were discussed above.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Mental toxins.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These are literally false and usually negative thinking that can apparently cause cancer.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Auto-intoxication.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is the generation of poisonous substances in the intestines, mainly due to an improper diet and usually impaired digestion and stress.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Genetic, or rather RNA transcription errors.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This overlaps almost completely with the toxic and nutritional causes of cancers above. However, you would not know this by the way doctors talk about cancer and genetics.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Life termination cancers.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is an interesting group of cancers. When some people become discouraged or too ill, they seem to make a decision to die. The soul may use cancer as a way to leave this earth. These cancers are harder to reverse, since doing so requires a new decision to live, rather than to die. Sometimes this is not hard to do, but sometimes the death wish it is hidden deep in consciousness and takes time and energy to change.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">The information above explains why one person is successful with one type of therapy, but it does not seem to work on someone else.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It also explains why I suggest that everyone realise that <b>all</b> of the causes<span id="a-simplification-of-cancer"></span> above may be in play with your cancer. Do not rule out any of them, and use an approach that addresses all of the causes above.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1">A simplification of cancer</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">A rough way to understand cancer is the following. Cancer loves:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><strong>1)</strong> low oxygen, <strong>2)</strong> a yin body (from eating fruit and sweets, old age, too much sex or other causes), <strong>3)</strong> sugars of all kinds in the diet, including fruit, <strong>4)</strong> absence of sunshine, <strong>5)</strong> low etheric energy from old age or ill health, <strong>6)</strong> resentment, in particular, and other negative emotions such as anger and fear, <strong>7)</strong> toxic bodies, <strong>8)</strong> yeast and fungus in the body, <strong>9)</strong> low levels of alkaline reserve minerals (that everyone has today due to low-mineral food and processed food diets), <strong>10)</strong> weak adrenal and thyroid glands, and <strong>11)</strong> excessive oestrogen levels, and <strong>12)</strong> jin shin jyutsu therapy, unfortunately.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Meanwhile, cancer hates:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><strong>1) </strong>high oxygen levels, <strong>2)</strong> red heat lamp therapy, <strong>3)</strong> high etheric energy in the body, <strong>4)</strong> coffee enemas, <strong>5)</strong> love, <strong>6)</strong> a less toxic body, <strong>7)</strong> absence of yeast and fungus in the body, <strong>8)</strong> high levels of alkaline reserve minerals, <strong>9)</strong> healthy thyroid and adrenal glands, and <strong>10)</strong> low or normal oestrogen levels.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Oestrogen and cancer. </b> Oestrogen, particularly some types of oestrogen, are potent carcinogens. This is related to the trophoblast theory of cancer, discussed elsewhere in this article. Reasons today for high oestrogen levels are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Toxic livers that are extremely common.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The liver must detoxify oestrogen.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Elevated copper levels and low zinc levels.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Copper and oestrogen levels tend to follow one another. Zinc is deficient in the soil, so it is deficient in our food supply, as well. Stress also lowers zinc and often raises copper in the body.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Possibly <b>a compensatory mechanism</b> that could result from some types of adrenal exhaustion.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Use of birth control pills</b> and patches and the birth control IUD.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Oestrogen-mimicking chemicals</b> used in chemical agriculture, mainly.<span id="alternative-cancer-therapies"></span></span></p>
<p class="p1">
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Now let us examine testing and therapies.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1">Alternative cancer therapies</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">There are many alternative cancer therapies. No one knows all there is about reversing cancer, so I can only share my experience. This article only discusses several alternative cancer therapies. <b>They are the only ones I suggest</b> at this time. The methods I suggest use fairly non-toxic cancer-killing agents. These therapies work quite well, when done properly and faithfully. With proper use, many cancers go away, often quite easily.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>WARNING about most holistic, alternative, or complementary cancer care.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Alternative medical care for cancer is a jungle, and full of problems, in my view. Most of the holistic doctors, naturopaths, chiropractors, and others do not have enough experience, do not know enough, or are simply not smart enough to do a good job, in many cases.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>I do NOT recommend</b> herbs, mushroom therapy, germanium, caesium, chelation therapy, homeopathy, IV vitamin C, iodine therapy, IPT (or insulin potentiation therapy), most electrical machines, raw food diets, beta glucan, cottage cheese and vegetable oil, IP-6, vegetarian diets, or baking soda treatments. I would strictly avoid all of these therapies.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">In my experience, these methods simply do not work well enough. They may cause some improvement for a while, but they do not work deeply enough. Some will guarantee death, in fact. Also, if you choose the three methods recommended in this article, you must do them correctly and faithfully. Do not fool around and change the protocols! That is a stern warning, since<span id="other-aspects-critical-for-success"></span> many cancer patients are either so worried or so scattered that they cannot follow a protocol very well.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1">Other aspects, critical for success</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Root-canal filled teeth.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I strongly suggest that anyone dealing with cancer have <b>all</b> root canal-filled teeth removed at once. I know this can be costly and drastic, but is often very important if you want to live. You would be surprised how toxic most root canal-filled teeth are. The only solution I know of is to have them removed, at once.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Dental amalgams.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>DO NOT replace dental amalgams when there is an active cancer. Wait until the cancer is in remission. The reason is the mercury removal process releases some mercury into the body. This can flare up the cancer and kill you. Also, never have more silver amalgam dental fillings placed in your mouth, as they are quite toxic.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Glandular products</b> (such as adrenal or thyroid glandulars).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>DO NOT TAKE GLANDULAR PRODUCTS IF YOU HAVE CANCER. Some cancers are hormone-driven and products such as adrenal or thyroid glandular supplements can make things worse. I also would avoid herbs that stimulate the glands or contain hormone-like substances for the same reason. These include liquorice root and other “adrenal herbs” and tyrosine or “thyroid herbs”.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>The use of raw liver.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Eating a little raw liver daily may help very ill cancer patients. This technique was first used by Max Gerson, MD and later by William Kelley, DDS. Due to its taste, the best way to do it is usually to buy fresh, raw, organic, free-range calf liver. Take it home and immediately cut it into small squares about 1-inch square. Place these in the freezer on a pan or plastic ice cube tray so they won’t stick together. Each day, eat about two of these directly from the freezer<span id="conventional-cancer-therapies"></span>. The coldness of the liver obscures its strong taste. This is still being researched, but may be helpful.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1">Conventional cancer therapies</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">As stated earlier, conventional cancer therapy – radiation, surgery or drugs — is generally quite insane, in my view. Its effectiveness is generally poor, its adverse effects are sometimes worse than the disease, and its cost is much too high. It basically poisons the patient and the cancer, hopefully poisoning the cancer a little more than it poisons the patient. This is one approach, and it sometimes works, but not that well in too many cases.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">However, it is all that is permitted today in mainstream medical care. Doctors that recommend other cancer therapies usually lose their license to practice medicine, so I would not even bother to ask them about alternative therapies.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Conventional medical methods are also often the only therapies that health insurance will pay for, because the insurance industry is heavily regulated and controlled by the drug industry. Otherwise, the insurance industry would realise that several natural therapies are 1) as effective or more effective than conventional therapy, 2) have fewer side effects, and 3) are much less costly.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>The best conventional therapy.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is often surgery. Surgery is fast and does not leave the patient as poisoned as does chemotherapy and radiation. However, one does get a lot of anaesthesia drugs that must later be removed from the body, ideally.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Surgery is often not needed if one uses the correct natural therapy. It should <b>only</b> be used in cases in which 1) the tumour is enormous and thus difficult to digest and remove naturally, or 2) if the tumour is pressing on a vital structure such as an artery or a nerve, and must be removed to save one’s life.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Also, one should use the natural therapies described in this article before and after surgery to prevent a recurrence of cancer, which is common. This means that one cannot remove all cancer surgically. It is always lurking elsewhere. Surgery is just good to remove large or life-threatening tumours, but not to heal the whole body.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Combining natural therapies with conventional cancer treatment.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is certainly possible. Nutritional Balancing can be done along with conventional cancer therapy. It is certainly better than doing conventional therapy without a natural healing programme. However, keep in mind that conventional cancer treatment is extremely toxic, the opposite of the goal of natural therapies, in general. Secondly, conventional treatment wastes the patient’s energy, usually depletes their nutrition, and often has other adverse effects.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Combining several natural therapies.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>PLEASE DO NOT DO THIS. It will usually wreck the Kelley programme or a Nutritional Balancing programme.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Nutritional Balancing for those undergoing conventional cancer therapies. </b> Nutritional Balancing can be used as an adjunctive and supportive therapy for those who have elected to pursue conventional cancer therapy such as chemotherapy, radiation or surgery. If you are not sure what to do, you can <a href="/contact/">contact us</a> for more information. Remember that Nutritional Balancing is not<span id="suggested-alternative-therapies"></span> a cancer therapy. It is a general health programme only and not a therapy for any disease or condition.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1">Suggested alternative therapies</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">The following are the <b>only</b> natural cancer therapies I suggest. Please be careful. I do not like most of the natural cancer therapies, as they are not good enough, no matter what some claim.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #28a9e0;">#1. Cantron or Protocel</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">This is quite an amazing remedy when combined with a complete Nutritional Balancing programme and a few important modifications to the Nutritional Balancing programme.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 12pt; color: #28a9e0;">#2. The Kelley metabolic therapy</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">This is the other natural cancer therapy that I think is actually the best one. It is much more costly than Cantron, however, and often not necessary if one uses Cantron and a complete Nutritional Balancing programme.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Some excellent adjunctive therapies are discussed below.</b>  They are <i>only to be used with one of the two therapies listed above</i>, as they are not enough by themselves.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 12pt; color: #28a9e0;">#1. Oxygen therapies</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Extra oxygen can kill cancer cells.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is a fairly safe, and often a fairly simple therapy, as well. Oxygen is available in various forms and modalities:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Practice deep breathing every day</b>, for at least one hour. Really stretch your abdomen and chest when you breathe. This can greatly enhance oxygenation of the body and is very easy. Do deep breathing for at least 1 hour daily.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Ozone.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is another excellent way to increase oxygenation of the body. Ozone and deep breathing are best because they are the most yang methods of increasing oxygen in the body. Peroxide and hyperbaric oxygen are more yin, which is not helpful. Ozone can be taken rectally, in an IV solution, breathed in, in a bath, in a steam cabinet, and in your drinking water.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Ozone is O3, an unstable form of oxygen that gives off one of its oxygen atoms to your body when it is placed inside the body. Everyone can buy an ozonator/ioniser air purifier and set it up in the bedroom, preferably, and breathe some ozone all night and day, as well. Rectal ozone, bubbling ozone into a bath, or an ozone steam cabinet are also home therapies and not too difficult.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">A very good combination is a peroxide bath (described below) and a tube with ozone placed in the same bath and perhaps near the cancer.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Hydrogen peroxide.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is a very corrosive compound that can be added to baths, mainly, or possibly added to drinking water. I do not suggest it quite as much as ozone because bathing in tap water is too contaminated. However, it is widely available and inexpensive. A peroxide bath is very good, and consists of a hot bath at least on the legs, with about 250ml of 35% food grade hydrogen peroxide added. Soak for at least half an hour. Repeat up to three times weekly. Stop if you do not feel better after a time, as oxygen is limited in its effect on cancer, but very good, at times.</span></p>
<p class="p1">
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 12pt; color: #28a9e0;">#2. Black salve</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">This is an ancient Native American herbal formula used to remove skin cancers, but it also works on some internal cancers. While it can be irritating, it usually does an excellent job on skin cancers, in particular! It is also extremely inexpensive and not too toxic.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">It<span id="what-is-cancer"></span> can easily remove cancerous and pre-cancerous moles very easily, as well as some skin infections. A book about it is <i>Cancer Salves</i> by Ingrid Naiman. </span></p>
<h3 class="p1">What is cancer?</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Doctors differ in their beliefs about exactly what cancer is. According to some, however, it is a normal type of cell line that simply expresses or grows at the wrong time and place. The cell line is called the trophoblast.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">The word trophoblast means “to nourish the blast or baby”. The cell line should only arise during the first eight to twelve weeks of pregnancy. Its function is to nourish the foetus until what is called the critical period of pregnancy, when the placenta grows and takes over the job of nourishing the foetus.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">According to the theory, as our bodies age and break down slowly, this older tissue line becomes active in the wrong time and place, and this is cancer. As early as 1902, John Beard, MD, a brilliant embryologist, wrote <i>The Trophoblast Theory Of Cancer</i>. To my knowledge, the theory has withstood many tests, yet one rarely hears about it. I wonder if the reason is that if it were shown to be true<span id="cancer-prevention"></span>, the answer for this disease recommended in 1902 would have to be applied, and the entire cancer “business” would end.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1">Cancer prevention</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Cancer is one disease that is far better to prevent than to treat, in most cases. Here is why:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">It can be very advanced, and fast-moving, yet no symptoms may be present. Just last month, a friend called because his 28-year-old young son had minor surgery for an abdominal problem. Much to everyone’s surprise, his abdomen was full of cancer, and he soon died. This is unfortunately a common story.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Dissolving tumours is not that easy for the human body, especially one with impaired eliminative organs. This greatly slows healing of cancer and causes many failures in natural and conventional cancer therapies. The body’s detoxification system is just overwhelmed. This is one reason I only suggest the two natural methods that I do, and no others at this time. It is also why coffee enemas are a key to natural cancer therapy. Skipping them is just foolishness.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">All illness is more difficult to handle in older people, and these are the ones who usually suffer with cancer.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Cancer is life-threatening and will take the life if one does not stop it. Thus, just slowing it down is better than nothing, but is not enough, as it is with many other illnesses. Cancer must be stopped, as a general rule, or life will end sooner, if not later.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #28a9e0;">Near infrared sauna therapy</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">The use of a near infrared heat lamp sauna is a very cost-effective and powerful method to help prevent and help eliminate cancers. For prevention one must use the lamp sauna daily for at least 60 minutes daily. Ideally, have two 30-minute sessions daily. I would also suggest a Nutritional Balancing programme.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">If one has cancer, one must either use a three-lamp sauna three times daily for at least 30 minutes each, or use a four-lamp sauna twice daily for at least 30 minutes each. There is something helpful about the rays from the reddish 250-watt incandescent heat lamps. A far infrared sauna or a traditional hot rocks sauna are not nearly as good, as they do not offer the rays from the 250-watt incandescent heat lamps. Far infrared saunas may be harmful due to the stray electromagnetic fields they all produce.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Near infrared sauna therapy helps remove two dozen toxic metals, hundreds of toxic chemicals, and often a dozen or more chronic infections in the body. It also has many other therapeutic effects. Saunas do far more than just reduce the risk of cancer, and are not a specific cancer therapy, unless combined with other products and procedures. Thus, it can also help prevent a dozen other devastating illnesses, at least, and actually rejuvenates the body as it does so.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">If one is serious about cancer prevention, include the use of a near infrared sauna as a primary preventive therapy<span id="hair-analysis-patterns-seen-often-with-cancer"></span>. One can either buy or build a lamp sauna. Please <a href="/contact/">contact us</a> for more information</span></p>
<h3 class="p1">Hair analysis patterns seen often with cancer</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Certain metabolic patterns that are visible on a properly performed and properly interpreted <a href="/how-it-works/hair-tissue-mineral-analysis/">Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis</a> are more associated with cancer. Here are those that occur most often, though there are others as well:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 12pt; color: #28a9e0;">Sympathetic dominance</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Excessive activity of the sympathetic nervous system inhibits healing in at least five different ways. If this factor is not dealt with, no therapy will be too effective. The tendency to overuse the sympathetic nervous system, which we call sympathetic dominance, is often unconscious. This only makes it worse, because the person thinks he or she is just living “normally”, but in fact the person is stuck in a trap or vicious cycle of tissue breakdown or catabolism due to the overuse of the sympathetic nervous system. I tell people it is as though they believe they are being chased by a pack of tigers all the time. This inhibits digestion, elimination and the immune response severely, and slowly tears down the body.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">On a hair analysis, it is indicated by a potassium level of 4 mg% or less, or three or four highs pattern with a slightly elevated sodium/potassium ratio. Secondary indicators are an elevated sodium/potassium ratio by itself, and/or an elevated calcium/magnesium ratio if the sodium/potassium ratio is high.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Pancreatic enzymes and Cantron may actually help to correct this tendency, and this may account for some of the feelings of fatigue that people with active cancer may feel for a time on these products. Coffee enemas and sauna therapy are also excellent to counteract sympathetic dominance.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 12pt; color: #28a9e0;">Four lows pattern</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">This pattern is also common, and consists of low tissue levels of calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 12pt; color: #28a9e0;">Elevated copper, calcium and/or cadmium</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">A copper level greater than about 10 mg%, a calcium level greater than 400 mg%, and/or a cadmium level above about 0.03 mg%, are other possible cancer indicators on a properly performed hair analysis. As these correct, the likelihood of cancer will decrease, in my experience.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 12pt; color: #28a9e0;">A sodium/potassium ratio less than 2</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Dr. Paul Eck noted that on a properly performed hair analysis, a sodium/potassium ratio less than 2.5 is associated with an impaired immune response. As the ratio becomes lower, the tendency for immune deficiency and malignancy increases.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 12pt; color: #28a9e0;">Phosphorus less than 12 mg%</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">This is a low vitality indicator.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 12pt; color: #28a9e0;">Other toxic metals or severe vital mineral deficiencies</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">High levels of mercury, lead, arsenic, nickel or other toxic metals may be associated with the development of cancer. Very low levels of zinc, for example, may also indicate a severely impaired immune response. More research is needed on the specifics of these indicators.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Where<span id="problems-with-conventional-cancer-diagnoses-and-screening"></span> appropriate, the above patterns are explained in detail in your comprehensive written report.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1">Problems with conventional cancer diagnoses and screening</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Breast cancer.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Perhaps the best method of screening for breast lumps is a monthly breast self-exam. It is simple, has no cost, and requires no doctor’s appointments, x-rays or other tests. It is also quite effective if a woman follows the directions that are on many websites as to how to do a breast self-exam.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">The standard test used for breast screening is a mammogram, which I do not recommend at all for the following reasons:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Mammograms expose one to too much radiation if done on a regular basis.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Mammograms have many false positive results. This causes stress on many women, leads to more invasive surgeries that may not be needed, and is costly.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Damage to the breasts. Mammograms require that the breasts be pressed hard against the x-ray unit. This actually damages the breasts. In some women, their breasts are tender for days after a mammogram.</span></p>
<p class="p1">
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">I believe you can do as well or better with a combination of breast self-examination once a month and perhaps the use of thermography. This is a newer method of screening for breast cancer. It is a “heat picture” of the breasts that detects changes in the heat density of the breasts with a fair degree of accuracy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">The procedure is simple and much less painful and involved than mammography. It is as good as mammography in many ways, without the x-rays and without damaging the breasts. Some authorities maintain that thermography is actually much better than mammography and can detect changes in the breast years before cancer even develops.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Biopsy errors.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Please be warned that biopsies can be unreliable. They can produce false positive and false negative results. Try to confirm biopsy findings, if at all possible, since false positive results can cause extensive treatments when they may not be needed. This relates to the next topic.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Defensive medicine.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Today, many doctors practice what is called defensive medicine. This is really not medical care, but legal care. They may diagnose an early cancer even if they are not sure, because this is preferable to missing the diagnosis and getting sued.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">I appreciate their careful approach. However, a person can end up on very toxic drugs, or having toxic radiation therapy and surgery without needing it. They can also become very depressed and anxious for no reason. So please beware of this situation in today’s medical care. The answer, in my opinion, is that if you receive a diagnosis of this type, go on Cantron and a Nutritional Balancing programme. This will almost always take care of the cancer without the need for further medical intervention.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Beware of medical “preventive testing”.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>X-rays of the breasts, for example, increase cancer incidence. Ultrasound or infrared thermal imaging, by contrast, are much safer. This is just one example of how prevention must be carefully thought out.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Beware of genetic testing.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Genetic testing (really protein synthesis testing) is the newest form of medical testing that is used today to screen for a tendency for certain cancers. It is critical to understand that genetic testing is not just DNA testing. It also tests for transcription or copying errors, which are correctable. This can be very confusing, and needlessly scary!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Very few, if any doctors understand the testing well enough to properly interpret it. Misinterpretation can cause severe problems, such as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Unnecessary surgery</b>, such as breast removal or mastectomy for fear of cancer. </span></p>
</li>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Intense fear, depression and despair</b>, when it may not be warranted.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Unnecessary drug therapy</b>, or other unnecessary diagnostic or other procedures.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>High cost of testing</b> which raises health care costs.</span></p>
<p class="p1">
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="emp" style="font-size: 10pt; text-align: center; padding-right: 2em; padding-left: 2em;"><strong>A Nutritional Balancing programme can cause what looks like cancerous growths, but they are not.</strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Recently, two people who were on Nutritional Balancing programmes suddenly developed “lumps”, that were then diagnosed with cancer. However, upon closer investigation, one was actually told she just had pre-cancerous cells. In both cases, the problem was a healing reaction and the lumps went away on their own. </span><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Reasons for the confusion and possible misdiagnoses are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Only on a Nutritional Balancing programme, the body can move toxins easily into a cyst or benign tumour to make them easier to remove. So a lump appears. It is not cancer, in my experience, but a process of ridding the body of cancer, even though it contains some abnormal cells.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Most cancers require 5-10 years to develop. Nutritional Balancing programmes do not tend to promote cancer growth, and in fact the opposite is true.</span></p>
<p class="p1">
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Common medical errors in handling cancer.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Treating cancer as a local disease instead of a systemic one. This tends to cause relapses or recurrences. Doctors then treat these as “new” cancers, when they are just the progression of the same illness that was mistreated the first time with drugs or other methods that do not strengthen and detoxify the entire body.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Using extremely toxic drugs and radiation as a first line of treatment, rather than as a last resort in most cases.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Ignoring very high quality nutrition and diet, drinking water, food supplements, and perhaps other lifestyle factors when addressing cancer.</span></p>
<p class="p1">
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Ignoring<span id="reasons-for-failure-with-natural-cancer-therapies"></span> wonderful detoxification procedures such as coffee enemas and the daily use of a near infrared sauna.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="p1">Reasons for failure with natural cancer therapies</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">These factors are common reasons for failure. By understanding these factors you can make conscious decisions to avoid them.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Stress.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For success, you must minimise all activity and stress in your life. You must rest at least 12 hours daily. Stress weakens and disturbs the body severely. It can include financial, social, work, family or other types of stressful conditions. To be successful, plan to rest most of the day for at least a year or two. This will conserve your energy for healing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Starting too late.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am aware of people with extremely advanced cases of cancer that recovered fully using natural therapies. Therefore, it is never too late to begin natural therapy.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">However, there can be no foolproof “cure” for cancer. Anyone who offers you one is lying. The main reason is that cancer is a stealth disease and you never know how extensive it is, no matter how many x-rays or tests are run. Also, you never know just how low your vitality level is, and vitality or adaptive energy is required to recover from cancer, as with all diseases. It takes some time to turn around any disease condition, and one never knows if one has that time. Also, digesting and disposing of dead tumours takes a lot of the body’s energy and can be another problem, even if the cancer can be stopped. Therefore, if you suspect cancer, start your alternative programme immediately.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Failure to follow the programme completely and faithfully. </b> This is the most common reason for failure. Here are some reasons this can happen:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Altering the programme.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is all too common. Doctors or patients often just omit parts of the programme, such as coffee enemas. Others try combining programmes, often with disastrous results. Others alter a few items, such as the diet, because they are afraid or have read something that influences them.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">A hard and fast rule is to avoid changing or omitting anything that is required, even if you don’t understand it. The Kelley programme, as administered by Pamela McDougle – but not anyone else — is the result of literally years of research. You are not likely to improve upon it. Dr. Kelley tried many remedies, and rejected most of them for very good reasons that are not known to most physicians and patients.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Nutritional Balancing programmes are also the result of 40 years of research. Patients do not realise that we have tried most, if not all of the remedies, methods and products available on the market. So if it is not recommended, stay away.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>f it is recommended, use it, even if it makes little sense.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Holistic physicians, often with little real experience with cancer, are among the worst offenders here. They may attend a seminar or workshop and suddenly feel they can do better than the masters. Adding extra products often wrecks a programme, and the reasons can be subtle. Be very careful about this.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">I<b>nability to do the programme.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This may be due to financial issues, mental confusion or even a lack of strength to carry out the instructions perfectly.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Lack of adequate supervision.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is also common. Always consult your practitioner if you are not sure what to do in a situation. Too many people end up in an emergency room, or stopping their programme when this is not the correct solution to a flare-up or other situation.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Remember, cancer is not a simple illness in most cases. In fact, cancer is more like a climb up a steep slope where you cannot see the goal clearly at first. There are wrong turns and hazards to avoid, so use care in whom you choose as your guide, and keep in close communication.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Lack of commitment.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Any natural approach takes commitment. It will usually not be easy sailing at all times and one must persist, even when it seems like things are not going well. This occurs during what are called healing reactions, for example.</span></p>
<p class="p1">
</p>
</li>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Quitting too soon.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is another common problem. Plan on staying on your therapy for several years, at least. The diet and lifestyle should be lifelong choices. One must stay with the natural therapy for at least a year after obvious tumours have shrunk or one feels much better. Otherwise, relapses can occur easily, since cancer is a degenerative condition.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Lack of emotional and moral support.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This, too, occurs often with alternative cancer approaches, more than with any other illness I am aware of. Some people feel they must have the support of their families, the media and the medical world. Otherwise they feel uncomfortable with their cancer regimen. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Alternative methods do not offer this. For best success, one must be far more independent of the attitudes of others, realising that they are usually terribly uninformed and misinformed. Often they are also terrified of cancer by the media and not thinking clearly about you and your real needs.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Lack of faith in the programme.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you believe strongly in someone or something, you will tend to relax, follow orders better, and have a better attitude. If you think you are wasting your time and money, no approach will be as effective.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">For this reason, watch out with whom you speak or share your condition, and your plans. Thoughtless or stray words from doctors and others can have a great influence on one who is ill. If you seek counselling or other help from a counsellor, family or friends, make sure they all understand your natural healing programme, and are fully supportive.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Reduced will to live.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Cancer often causes a person to question the will to live. In fact, it is one of cancer’s blessings. It forces a person to examine why he or she wants to be well at all. This is a challenge for those who have not examined their lives carefully<span id="what-if-you-are-not-succeeding"></span>, or who have lived less than wholesome lives. Even so, there are many ways to enhance the will to live.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">If the programme you have chosen is not causing any changes within a few weeks, even subtle ones described below, it may not be working. Fortunately, with the therapies in this article, this rarely happens. Early changes may be subtle and even have little to do with your tumour or cancer. They may be emotional improvements, for example. You may have more energy, feel happier or have less pain, even if the tumour has not changed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">In fact, do not expect your tumour or even your general health to change quickly in many cases. Only with the therapies mentioned in this article and perhaps a few others, tumours occasionally even grow larger for a short time as they soften and disintegrate. Also, tests such as x-rays and blood tests may also look worse, at times. This can be part of the process of tumour necrosis or destruction of the cancer.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Also, do not just pay attention to x-rays or other medical tests, which often cannot detect subtle changes inside tumours. However, if there are no changes at all, even subtle ones, don’t waste your time on something that is not working. Stop what you are doing and change to a different approach. The exception here is that when a healing reaction or retracing is taking place, one must stick with the programme. This is difficult, and this is where a professional who understands the programme deeply will be of great help. During all retracing, one’s judgment is affected and everyone needs outside help to see their way through.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Should you spend a lot of time with conventional doctors while on a natural therapy programme?</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is a difficult decision, at times. It is up to you how often you visit your conventional doctor, but I have found that staying away from the medical world as much as possible is often very helpful. This is not always the case, but here are my observations based on working with thousands of people:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">The medical world can be very depressing and discouraging.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Doctors and other medical personnel are often deeply afraid of cancer, themselves. They speak and gesture in a way that unconsciously instills fear in you.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Most doctors, including holistic doctors, are not well-informed about healing reactions, the Kelley programme, Nutritional Balancing science, etc. So they often inadvertently wreck the programmes by suggesting other remedies, other diets, or other therapies.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Sadly, the cancer establishment is corrupt. You may not think this is true, as most doctors are well-intentioned, as are most hospitals. However, the licensing boards control medical care and do not want the truth about metabolic cancer therapies to be known. </span></p>
</li>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">There is a built-in bias, in other words, against unusual natural therapies that doctors do not know much about. Their journals do not teach them about natural cancer therapy in an honest way, sadly, because they are supported by drug advertisements. I know this for a fact. So one cannot expect to hear the truth from one’s conventional doctor, although we all want it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Indeed, many patients are often “railroaded” into complying with doctor’s suggestions in various ways – even legal means. I am sorry to have to say all this, and I wish it were not true, but it is. Do not be deceived because your doctor is very “nice”, or concerned, or because he was educated at very fine universities. In my experience, none of this matters. This is very hard for some people to fathom – that with all their learning and research staffs, that their doctors might be almost totally ignorant when it comes to metabolic and natural approaches to cancer. However, it is the truth. I experienced this myself and it confused me for years, until I accepted this truth.</span></p>
