What are parasites?</span></h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Parasites are a large class of infective organisms that live on or in human beings, animals and plant species. They include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Flukes and worms.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This includes several hundred types of flat worms (such as tapeworms) and round worms (such as hook worms and ascaris). Also in this group are liver flukes, the most common parasites in America. These infect most people, to some degree, at least, because their eggs are so often found in swimming pools, hot tubs, bathtubs, gymnasium floors, and everything you touch that others touch such as armrests on aeroplanes, buses and trains, toilet flush levers in public or private bathrooms, and elsewhere. Even some municipal water supplies contain some, as they are difficult to kill.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">A very important parasite in this group is the trichina worm, found in <b>all</b> pig products. The exception is pig pancreas and thyroid, both of which are used medicinally &#8211; we have not found it here. However, no pig product is safe, in my opinion.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Worms and flukes usually don’t kill people outright. In most cases, they just accumulate in the liver, colon or elsewhere and cause certain symptoms.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Protozoa such as amoebas and giardia lamblia.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These are microscopic in size, and more associated with Mexico, South America, and unclean food and water in tropical countries. These can kill weak or ill people if they move from the intestines through a weak spot in the intestinal wall and migrate to the brain, lungs, heart or other vital organs. Eating spices can help to mitigate them.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Spirochetes or spiral-shaped organisms</b> such as those that cause Lyme disease, malaria and others. These are also very common, especially Lyme spirochetes, spread by flies, ticks and many other insects. </span></p>
</li>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Yeasts and fungi.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some people also include yeasts and fungi such as candida albicans in the group of infective agents that are termed parasites. Candida is extremely common, as it is a hardy organism.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">As you can see, there are many types of parasitic organisms, several hundred, in fact. Unlike bacteria and viruses<span id="symptoms"></span>, most parasites are large enough to be seen easily with a microscope, and some can be seen with the naked eye.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1">Symptoms</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">A mild case of parasites will often cause few, if any symptoms. As a result, millions of people walk around with parasites and have no idea they have them. In fact, most people have some. If a significant number of parasites are present, symptoms tend to be:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Worms and flukes</b> tend to cause a bloated belly to some degree, fatigue, a sad look on the face, slightly darker skin tone, malnutrition if the case is bad, and interestingly, a craving for fat, even more than cravings for sugar or sweets.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Protozoal parasites</b> cause diarrhoea, constipation, abdominal pain, fatigue, weight gain or weight loss, intestinal bleeding, rectal itching or itching anywhere in the body. Sometimes there is anaemia, headaches and many other symptoms are possible if the case is severe.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Spirochetes such as the Lyme parasite</b> (borrelia burgdorferi) causes a bullseye rash early on, which fades and later may cause joint pain, neck pain, headaches, brain fog, and other symptoms as it invades various tissues and organs.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Candida albicans</b> and other fermenting organisms may cause gas, bloating, brain fog<span id="therapeutic-principles"></span>, confusion, fatigue, weight gain and other symptoms depending upon where it is and how severe it is.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Therapeutic principles</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Parasitic infection is extremely common</b> and most everyone has some. Most people have Lyme spirochetes, liver flukes, trichina cysts or worms, and often others, as well. Infection with parasites is more likely if you work or live in contaminated areas, are not that clean in your living and sexual habits, travel the world, eat pork, ham or bacon, or live in Lyme-infected areas, such as the East and West coast of the USA.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Places where one finds the highest rate of parasitic infection tend to be in the tropics, and in nations with less cleanliness, and especially those where clean water is not readily available. They are also more common where people walk barefoot or work barefoot or in water, such as in rice paddies in Asia. However, parasites are everywhere, and not that easy to avoid.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">In so-called healthy people, the degree of infection is not severe, so there are few if any symptoms, and the parasitic infection does not affect the person very much.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Parasites are opportunists</b> and thrive in more yin and sick bodies. An important principle of parasitic infection is that parasitic infections are generally worse if your health is poor. In this regard, they are opportunist organisms that thrive in sick bodies. Literally, they have more to eat if one is ill. Also, the weakness of the body in terms of its electrical nature, acid-alkaline balance, and enzyme strength, makes it easier for parasites to thrive in sick bodies. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Detecting parasites</b> can be extremely difficult. Some are very small, some live deep in the liver or the brain, and none of the tests, in my experience, are that reliable. It is fine to do testing, but do not rely on testing alone. I do not bother with testing for parasites in most cases, because I assume they are present in everyone, to some degree. Testing can be helpful to confirm them, but realise that it is not totally reliable.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Healing parasitic infections</b> is really a two-stage process of 1) reducing the parasite load, and 2) completely eliminating all the parasites. This is a very important medical principle in dealing with parasites.</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Stage 1 &#8211;</b> <b>Reducing the parasite load.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is what most medical and natural methods achieve. It is often adequate to improve one’s health. It can be done with medical drugs, or with toxic herbs such as cloves, black walnut husks, wormwood and others.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Another method is to use a Rife frequency generator, homeopathy or other machines. Enemas and other purges can also help. Nutritional Balancing science uses GB-3, a powerful digestive aid, coffee enemas, heat lamp saunas that are very helpful, and a diet without sugars or wheat.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Stage 2 &#8211; Getting rid of all the parasites.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is much more difficult because parasites can hide all over the body where drugs and herbs cannot reach them. Also, if the body is weak or ill, there is a lot of debris and other matter for them to nourish themselves with. Some are relatively easy to get rid of such as pinworms. Others, such as liver flukes, are very tenacious. Also, even if you get rid of them all, re-infection occurs easily because they are all around us, to a degree.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">When people say they have gotten rid of their parasites, usually it means they have reduced their numbers to where they are not bothersome and they are harder to detect. In our experience, Nutritional Balancing can eventually get rid of parasites completely, but it takes a number of years of rebuilding one’s health. The other methods mentioned above such as drugs, herbs, machines or purges usually cannot get rid of all the parasites.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">There are<b> two basic ways to get rid of most parasites</b>: 1) kill them with usually toxic methods, and/or 2) make the body a less hospitable host, which either kills them or they leave on their own. This is another important principle to understand. If you the balance of the body chemistry, you may not see them leave. However, they will slowly stop reproducing if the terrain of your body is not suitable for them.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Most parasite remedies are toxic</b> to some degree and therefore best avoided. This includes medical drugs, herbs, colloidal silver, grapefruit seed extract, oregano oil and the others. The least toxic are homeopathic remedies and Rife frequency therapies. However, these are quite yin and definitely harmful, for this reason. They also usually do not remove all the parasites, but only reduce their numbers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Nutritional Balancing</b> does not kill parasites with toxic products. However, it makes the body less suitable for their survival, so they are either expelled or simply leave and go elsewhere. Important advantages of this method of handling parasites are: 1) no toxic products are required, and 2) re-infection is much less common. Even if you are re-exposed to them, the body will not support them nearly as well. The disadvantage to this method is it may be slower than taking drugs or herbs, although not necessarily.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Some<span id="sources"></span> of these principles are explored in more depth later in this article.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1">Sources of exposure</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Parasites live everywhere, though they thrive best in warm, moist, often tropical, and dirty environments. They are a disease of filth and are usually present on foods, in water, even in the air and on other contact surfaces that are not cleaned well enough. For this reason, going barefoot, eating raw or improperly cooked food, and lack of hygiene are the main sources of parasites. More specifically:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Liver fluke eggs</b> are found throughout the world on food, on napkins, silverware, glasses, in the air and in the water supplies. They are almost impossible to avoid, even if one observes excellent cleanliness.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Hookworm and round worm eggs</b> are found in dirt, on dirt floors, especially, and on all unclean surfaces that people walk on and touch. For this reason, round and hookworm infections are diseases of filth. Cleanliness is essential to avoid them. Wearing shoes, and better yet, closed shoes, is a wise idea in all tropical nations.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Trichina worm cysts</b> are found in all pig products, in my opinion, even if the pork, bacon, lard or ham are cooked well. This is an important reason to stop eating pig products entirely! They move into the brain easily, and are endemic among populations that eat a lot of pig products anywhere in the world. This is one reason that the kosher laws forbid eating products of the pig.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Lyme disease and malaria</b> are carried by insects of various kinds. Lyme disease is difficult to avoid today, no matter where one lives. Most people have it to some degree. Malaria requires any of about 40-50 species of female anopheles mosquitos as its vector or carrier. For this reason, it is mainly limited to certain tropical areas where these mosquitos are present in large numbers. Malaria maps and mosquito maps on the internet can show you where they are. If you live in or travel to one of these nations, do your best to take precautions such as always sleeping under mosquito netting, wearing long sleeves and long trousers, wearing socks and shoes, and avoiding mosquito-infected swamps and other dangerous areas. Malaria is often rampant in these areas, and it will shorten the lifespan of most people.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Candida albicans</b> and other candida species are everywhere on dishes, glasses, silverware, on food, and everything people touch or wear. Wash you hands several times daily, and always wash and preferably shower after you have been in contact with others, after going to restaurants, after sex, after sleeping in hotels, and after other contact with people or places where people have been such as theatres, cinemas, stadiums, studios such as television studios, schools and universities, and elsewhere. I know this is difficult, but it is helpful to reduce the spread of conditions such as candida albicans and some other parasitic diseases.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">The worst areas of the world for parasitic disease are generally poor nations, those with bad sanitation systems, dirt floors instead of tile, linoleum, wood or carpet flooring, and in nations with contaminated and polluted water and food supplies.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong><span class="s1" style="color: #28a9e0;">Food sources</span></strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Especially avoid <b>all raw or poorly cooked meats</b>, fish, seafood and shellfish. This applies to all nations. Sushi, which is sadly very nutritious, is a big source of problems in developed nations of Europe, Japan, America and others. I am saddened to have to respond to the lies that raw meats or raw fish are healthful, at all. On the contrary, they are usually full of parasitic eggs and cysts.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Avoid eating <b>all unwashed fruit</b> and all poorly washed vegetable salads if you want to avoid more parasites. I suggest one should never eat salad or fruit with skin unless you wash it yourself. This means avoiding <b>all</b> salads and <b>all</b> fruit with skin in restaurants. One never knows who washed the lettuce or the apples, and how well and how cleanly it was done. Remember, today many food service employees are from unclean nations, and their hygiene must be questioned. This is not an accusation against any particular group or nation, but it is the truth. Also remember that many fruits, vegetables, meats and fish come from unclean tropical nations. For this reason, the problem of cleanliness of raw foods is far worse today than ever before, and getting worse by the day. Finding out if the food is clean is basically impossible, so you must assume all food is contaminated until proven otherwise.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">As stated above, to avoid trichina infection of the brain and elsewhere, I would avoid <b>all pig products</b> such as ham, bacon, pork, lard, pig skin, sausage made with pork intestine, pork rinds and other products of the pig. It does not seem to matter if it is well-cooked. The only exception is porcine pancreatin, which appears to be very safe. Perhaps this is because pancreatin digests most everything, including parasite ova.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="color: #28a9e0; font-size: 14pt;"><strong><span class="s1">Water sources</span></strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Drinking water</b> supplies are a major source of parasitic infection around the world. Never drink tap water in most nations, even for brushing your teeth. Also, if possible, always use warm or hot water and a lot of soap to wash dishes and clothing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Important water-related sources</b> of parasites are pools, hot tubs, hot springs, boating clubs and facilities, cruise ships, and wet or damp floors in health clubs and gyms. Just because a pool or hot tub has been “sanitised” with chlorine or bromine does not mean that all micro-organisms have been killed. Some cysts and eggs survive very well in these places. For this reason, I suggest strictly avoiding all public pools or hot tubs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Even lake water, river water and occasionally ocean water can be contaminated with parasites. Ocean water is safest because few parasites can survive in the salty water. Fresh water is commonly contaminated, often by human beings or animals who use the water for bathing and relieving themselves. Untreated sewage also may find its way into lakes, streams and some ocean areas, as well.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">So swim only in the ocean, clean lakes or rivers, or seek out healthful and very clean-flowing hot springs, which are scattered everywhere on the earth and much better because the water comes directly out of the ground, and is pure and always flowing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Notes on chlorine and bromine:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></b>These are powerful toxins that are best avoided. The amount in most municipal bathing and drinking water is not too bad, although it has found its way into all our food, as a result of its widespread use. This has damaged the entire food supply on earth, and harmed all the soils of the earth. While these chemicals kill many germs, they do not kill all parasite cysts and ova. They are also highly toxic and cause the bodies of people, animals and plants to become more yin, which worsens susceptibility to all parasites.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Ozone and hydrogen peroxide are much better methods to sanitise all water in the world, although they are not perfect, either. Sanitising and producing healthful drinking and bathing water for all people of the earth should be a major priority in all nations, and is a costly, but important public health concern for all nations. I hope it will receive more attention than it already does. Until then, in most nations, drink only bottled water, and only water directly out of a sealed bottle, even for brushing your teeth and for cooking.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Wine, beer and other alcoholic beverages.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While cleaner than many water supplies, I do not suggest drinking wine or other alcoholic beverages. Among alcoholic beverages, beer and distilled spirits are usually the cleanest, interestingly. Wine is the worst and may contain parasite cysts, some arsenic and perhaps a little lead used in fertilisers and pesticides applied to the grapes. Grain beverages such as beer are actually more yang and therefore better than fruit-based beverages such as wine, especially sweet wines. However, I would not drink these beverages for optimum health.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Notes on reverse osmosis water:</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I do not recommend reverse osmosis water. In my experience, it does not hydrate the body very well, it causes a type of plastic poisoning from the polycarbonate or other type of membrane used to make it, and it is mineral-deficient and very yin for this reason. However, if you are traveling in an unclean nation, reverse osmosis bottled water may be the best alternative, and it can be used for a short while by most people. If you live in a nation with unclean water, please seek out a clean bottled spring water for regular drinking, as it will be much better for you than always drinking reverse osmosis bottled water.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Watch out for brands such as Nestles, Dasani and Aqua Fina. These are made by reverse osmosis and are not spring waters, though they can be found in the spring water sections of supermarkets, unfortunately. Also watch out for “drinking waters” and “purified waters” in health food stores and elsewhere, as these, too, are usually just tap water that is run through a reverse osmosis filter.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Notes on bottled soft drinks in unclean nations:</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>While I am definitely not a fan of Coca-cola or other soft drinks, these companies have actually helped the nations where these drinks are sold because they make sure the water they use is adequately filtered so as not to spread disease. This is important to know if you travel to unclean nations, as these beverages at least will not spread parasitic and other water-borne diseases, provided you drink them straight from the bottle or can. Do not make a habit of this, but know this if you need a beverage and no spring water or reverse osmosis water is immediately available. Ideally, always bring your own water with you when traveling through unclean nations or areas.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><strong><span class="s1" style="font-size: 14pt; color: #28a9e0;">Airborne sources</span></strong></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">This is not a major source of parasites, most of the time. The only exception is if one is breathing contaminated air, for example in a chicken coup or even some cities where debris and garbage take to the air and one may breathe in cysts of parasites.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 14pt; color: #28a9e0;"><strong><span class="s1">Contact sources</span></strong></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Troublesome areas are all public places where one touches chairs, toilets, sinks, beds, money (paper or coins) or anything else that has been touched by many people. Such places include theatres, auditoriums, laundrettes, cafés, buses, trains, aeroplanes, restaurants, and many other public locations. This is why frequent hand washing, wiping down toilet seats before sitting on them, and other hygienic measures are absolutely essential in public places of all kinds. Wealthier nations tend to be cleaner, however, watching your hygiene today is critical no matter where you live.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Children spread a lot of parasites.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We must add to contact sources the enormous spread of parasitic diseases that occurs among family members. Today, sadly, many children are born with parasites that are passed on from the mother, although the placenta affords newborn babies some protection from parasite infection. Mothers should take care of their parasitic infections before giving birth, if possible, as some live in the vagina and can easily infect their babies, causing blindness in some cases or other problems. Sexual hygiene is the key here. Husbands and boyfriends must be treated along with their female partners in all cases, if a disease is found.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Sexual activity.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sexual contact is a common cause of parasitic infections such as chlamydia. Sexual activity also always spreads bacterial infections such as syphilis, gonorrhoea, and others, and viral infections such as herpes.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Home contact.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The dirtiest rooms in most homes are the bathroom and kitchen. Floors should be washed, not just swept or vacuumed, at least once a week. Use a steam mop, not a regular mop that just moves the dirt around, too often. Only the steam mop mixed with a little soap, can kill or remove most parasite eggs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Pets and farm animals.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Animals are often infected with parasites, and these can spread to people easily. Pets should be de-wormed periodically, about once a year, according to many veterinarians. If your animal is indoors all the time, this is less of a problem, but still a possibility.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Dogs and perhaps chickens are the cleanest of the small animals, even dogs who roam out of doors daily. I am not sure why this is so, but it appears to be the case. Never own pigs, please, and if you must be around them, wash your hands often and deeply. They carry the most disease, it seems, although I am not sure why.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">The problem of parasites in farm and livestock animals is a daunting one. Causes for the problem stem from raising animals in very close quarters, not enough sunshine, cheap food, bad water, widespread use of medical drugs and vaccines, the use of other chemicals used on the farms and ranches for cleaning and other purposes, and some resulting contamination of the food, water and air of our livestock animals. Modern methods of livestock production are more sterile, perhaps, but there is a price in using more chemicals. The animals have become more yin in nature, negatively affecting their ability to resist parasitic attack.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Garlic for dogs and perhaps cats.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Giving dogs and maybe cats small amounts of garlic daily can reduce and eventually eliminate some parasites such as heart-worms in dogs. Please beware that <b>too much garlic is toxic<span id="detection"></span> </b>and can be lethal for cats, in particular. However, small amounts of garlic can be safer than the anti-parasitic drugs, and can do a better job, in some cases.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1">Detection</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Detecting many parasites is very difficult, as mentioned above. They can hide in various organs, and none of the tests are totally reliable. Here are a few words about the most common types of tests used. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Stool examinations.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Stool exams are used commonly, but are notoriously inaccurate. The reason is that the laboratory only analyses a small amount of the stool. It may not contain the parasites, even though they are present in the body. Parasites also go through life cycles, and an exam done at the wrong time of the month, so to speak, will miss the eggs or ova or the entire parasites for this reason, as well.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">One can also test the stool for occult blood. This may be caused by parasitic infection, although one must rule out other causes, so the test is not that reliable.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Bowel contents exams.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A few laboratories may offer a “bowel contents exam”. This is a very time-consuming and costly test in which the patient is given a laxative and must sit at the lab for several hours and collect everything that comes out of the bowel. The lab then analyses the entire contents, hopefully. This is not widely offered, however, and is very expensive. Also, it still can miss some items, and it only detects parasites in the bowel, of course.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Blood tests.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Serum tests for antibodies and others are also not perfectly reliable, as one may be exposed to parasites, so there can be false positives as well as false negatives.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Biopsies, x-rays, PET scans and MRIs. </b> These are occasionally useful, but are rarely done unless one has a strong suspicion and knows exactly what one is looking for. They are the only methods to detect parasites deep in the internal organs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Anyone with a four lows pattern on a hair mineral test probably has parasites. Other patterns are not clear indicators of parasitic infection, in my experience.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span class="s1">While a properly performed hair mineral test does not specifically detect parasites, it does provide the information needed to set up a Nutritional Balancing programme that will slowly eliminate all parasites from the body. You can find out more about hair analysis <a href="/how-it-works/hair-tissue-mineral-analysis/">here</a>.</span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Must one test for parasites?</b> I do not routinely test for parasites for the following reasons:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">I assume that most people have parasites.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Standard tests are not that reliable.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Nutritional Balancing programmes, especially with GB-3, near infrared sauna therapy and coffee enemas, will immediately begin to reduce the parasite load and eventually will get rid of most of them without needing testing or other anti-parasitic agents or drugs.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">The tests often add unnecessary cost, in our view.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>When to test for parasites?</b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Possible situations are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">One could test for parasites if one is having a bad reaction to coffee enemas and/or GB-3, which upset parasites in the body and are beginning the removal process. In almost all instances, however, I would not test for parasites, but rather recommend continuing the programme as best one can, and eventually the parasites will be expelled.</span></p>
</li>
<li class="p1">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">If<span id="drugs-and-herbal-correction"></span> a person will not follow a Nutritional Balancing programme, then testing and using toxic remedies may be needed, at times, for Lyme disease and others.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Drugs and herbal correction</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Anti-parasitic pharmaceutical drugs.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These drugs include metronizadole (Flagyl, Helidac, Metizol, Metric 21, Metro IV, Metrogel, Neo-metric, Novonidazole, Prostat, Satric, Trikacide), itraconazole (Sporanex), ketoconizole (Nizoril), fluconizole (Diflucan), quinacrine, (Atabrine) and perhaps others.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Anti-parasitic drugs are often not all that helpful, and many are extremely toxic. They may have a temporary effect, but if the body is not made stronger with a complete Nutritional Balancing programme, the drugs will not work well, or the parasites often come back to the same extent after the drug therapy is over. These drugs are quite toxic for the liver and perhaps for other organs, so they slow the general healing of the body. I would avoid them all. Always use the natural methods first such as a Nutritional Balancing programme and natural remedies.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">There may be exceptions to the above in a few situations. However, so far, we have never needed to resort to anti-parasitic drugs to clear parasites. Drugs should only be used if all other methods above are not working. I believe that Nutritional Balancing and, if needed, other natural methods are very powerful, in fact more so than the drugs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Herbs</b>, colloidal silver, diatomaceous earth, bentonite, Rife machines and other natural methods can work to varying degrees, and are generally less toxic than medical drugs. However, they tend to be somewhat toxic, and they will reduce the parasitic load, but not remove all parasites. I rarely need or use them, because Nutritional Balancing programmes will remove all parasites eventually, without needing these remedies.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Supplements and raw foods.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In addition to being somewhat toxic, another problem with <i>most</i> supplements and all herbs today is they are somewhat yin. This is harmful for the body and can actually increase the tendency for parasites. Raw food is also very yin, so even if it provides plenty<span id="elimination"></span> of nutrition, it can worsen the susceptibility to parasitic attack by making the body more yin.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1">Elimination</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Nutritional Balancing programmes can rid the body of hundreds of different parasites without requiring remedies such as herbs, medical drugs, machines or others. The anti-parasitic effect most likely occurs for the following reasons:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>A more yang diet.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The diet for those on a Nutritional Balancing programme always includes avoiding all sweets and sugars, including fruits, because sugars tend to nourish parasites. Also, parasitic infections are generally “cold” or “yin”, and this is made much worse by eating sugars of any kind at all, even milk. The diet also limits fat, which also feeds some parasites.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Increased vitality.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Enhancing overall vitality of the body is essential to rid the body of parasites. Parasites are very low-energy creatures that thrive in sick bodies. As the vitality improves, they are often easily expelled. Increased vitality also enhances the body’s ability to resist new parasitic infestation.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Repair of the intestinal tract is a high priority.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is done by eliminating all fruit, all juices except a little carrot juice, all raw food, all wheat products, and all food chemicals and refined foods. A much better diet of this type slowly strengthens and balances the intestines.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Making the body much more yang.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Parasites thrive in a more yin body. They cannot survive in a more yang and healthier body.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>A focus on liver detoxification.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This increases bile flow. Bile is irritating and sometimes lethal for parasites.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>The use of GB-3.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is one of the most powerful digestive aids available. It contains a lot of ox bile, pancreatin, and Russian black radish. These components irritate parasites, help correct the intestinal pH, and have other beneficial effects.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>A better lifestyle</b> with more rest is helpful.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Ridding the body of toxic metals and toxic chemicals.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This enhances vitality and helps create an unfavourable terrain or environment for parasites.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Near infrared sauna therapy.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This helps to remove parasites in many ways. Heating the body a few degrees can weaken and disable some parasites, including the one that causes Lyme disease, and others. Improving circulation can help as well. Near infrared energy feeds the human body, but is not beneficial for most parasites. Other mechanisms may be at work in the sauna as well, such as removing toxic substances that parasites feed upon.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Coffee enemas.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is probably the most powerful single additional procedure used in Nutritional Balancing. It stimulates bile flow, mechanically cleans the colon, upsets many parasite nesting places, and the coffee is probably somewhat toxic for them as well. Many people call me to say they notice parasites in their stool after a coffee enema. Often they feel much better when the parasites are removed. The coffee may be directly toxic for the parasites, or the enema may just help loosen them and remove them from the body. The coffee enema also reduces liver toxicity and promotes extra bile secretion that weakens many parasites. Coffee enemas also have reflex effects throughout the body.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Colonic irrigation.</b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I rarely see a need for this procedure. However, if parasites in the colon are a real problem, then a series of five to ten colonic irrigations can be very helpful to quickly loosen and remove them. Combining this with a Nutritional Balancing programme is always best.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;"><b>Other supports.<span id="prevention"></span></b><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Adding garlic, lots of cooked vegetables, and ozone therapy can often help.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1">Prevention</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Preventing parasitic infection is best, of course. However, it requires a careful lifestyle, and even then it is difficult. Eat only cooked foods in restaurants, avoid all hot tubs, pools and other possible contaminated water and food. It also means attention to hygiene at all times.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Be aware that travel will increase your chances of parasitic infection. One should be sure to wear long sleeves, long pants and socks in damp areas where ticks and other insects live, and preferably do not go to these areas. I believe if people realised how prevalent parasitic infection is<span id="summary"></span>, as I notice as a physician who regularly receives calls from people who are eliminating worms, for example, most people would be far more careful with their food, water and hygiene practices.</span></p>
<h3 class="p1">Summary</h3>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 10pt;">Planet earth is teeming with parasitic diseases. Avoiding all of them is difficult, if not impossible. Fortunately, and quite amazingly, a properly designed Nutritional Balancing programme will make the body much more resistant to all parasitic attack. It may take several years of following a programme properly for this to occur. However, this will provide protection against most, if not all parasites. To my knowledge, this is the best method to prevent and heal parasitic infections.</span></p>
